Robotic Assisted Surgery (RAS) requires precise instrumentation to translate the surgeon's hand gestures into the movement of a surgical robot. The surgeon's movements should feel smooth and effortless, with the device acting as an extension of their hands. Haptic feedback controllers help bridge the gap between the physical and digital spaces. This specific hand controller functions as a back-drivable serial robotic linkage. 
The controller has three primary functions. First, it continually measures the state of all joint angles and converts these values into a global spatial representation (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw). These six parameters are then used to control the position and orientation of the surgical robot. Second, the controller is gravity compensated, using torque controllers on the motors. This type of control results in a weightless feeling where the output grip can be easily moved to any position and released, and the grip will maintain its current position. Lastly, the controller is capable of providing haptic feedback to the user in the form of directional force commands. These forces can be used to simulate contact feedback or to provide virtual workspace boundary limits.
